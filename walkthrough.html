  here's a demo lesson on a super simple app I just wrote
</p>
<p>
  there's a bug in the calculator! it works for - / and *, but adding is crazy!
</p>
<p>
  see if you can figure out how to fix this (work in view.html & controller.js)
</p>
<p>
  if you can't, check out the hint!
  <code>git checkout hint1</code>
