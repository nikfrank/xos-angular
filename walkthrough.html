<p>
  here's a demo lesson on a super simple app I just wrote
</p>
<p>
  there's a bug in the calculator! it works for - / and *, but adding is crazy!
</p>
<h3>
  HINT 1
</h3>
<p>
  check the type of num1 and num2 in the controller using the "typeof" javascript keyword
</p>
<p>
  if you can't get it still, check out hint2
  <code>git checkout hint2</code>
</p>
