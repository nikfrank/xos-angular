<p>
  here's a demo lesson on a super simple app I just wrote
</p>
<p>
  there's a bug in the calculator! it works for - / and *, but adding is crazy!
</p>
<h3>
  Solution
</h3>
<p>
  as you can see, the type is a string (not a number)
</p>
<p>
  there's two ways to fix this. Either we can parseInt num1 and num2 into numbers in the controller using
</p>
<p>
  $scope.ans = parseInt($scope.num1) + parseInt($scope.num2);
</p>
<p>
  or, we can put a type="number" attribute on the input elements (this is better because it tells the browser how to render)
