<p>
  here's a demo lesson on a super simple app I just wrote
</p>
<p>
  there's a bug in the calculator! it works for - / and *, but adding is crazy!
</p>
<p>
  what's happening is the "+" operator has a different meaning for numbers as for strings
</p>
<p>
  in our add function, we have::
</p>
<p>
  $scope.ans = $scope.num1 + $scope.num2;
</p>
<p>
  which would be fine as long as num1 and num2 are both numbers
</p>
<p>
  buuuut, if they're strings, the "+" will act as a string concatenator instead of adiition
</p>
<p>
  and since we aren't telling angular what type to expect, it uses what it sees default from the input box (string)
</p>
<p>
  the other operators work because they're only defined for numbers.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  so there's two ways of fixing this:: from the view or the controller
</p>
<p>
  we can either put a type="number" attribute on the input boxes (which I like better, as this also indicicates to the browser how he should render the input box)
</p>
<p>
  or if we don't want that,  we can parse the input into an integer in the add function
</p>
